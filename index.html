                      He truly enjoys learning from her and is growing week by week!  I cannot recommend her

                    "So, here’s the thing. I’ve been a classroom teacher for 20 years, and still I am regularly 
                    amazed at the instructional moves that Georgia has with my 5 year old- and that’s online! 
                    When my daughter gets silly, she’s able to roll with it and then gently move her into a more 
                    productive task. When my daughter has something she’s interested in, Georgia flexibly moved 
                    the piano lesson in that direction, but still covers so many skill. As a result, my kid loves 
                    her piano lessons AND is progressing at a very age-appropriate pace. Did I mention she’s 
                    able to do all of this virtually? Georgia is truly the best teacher we could have ever 
                    hoped for."

                    If 6 stars were allowed, I would be asking if 7 stars were available.

                    fall in love with each piece you learn. I’m so thankful to have had her as my teacher for so many years, and I

                    "Georgia Sears is an inspiring and motivating piano teacher! We could not have found a better teacher when 
                    we moved to Arizona 16 years ago. She taught both my son and daughter for several years when she resided in 
                    the Phoenix west valley. She took their piano skills, musicality and artistry to new heights while guiding 
                    them in winning several competitions and awards.  They not only grew as pianists, but also developed a love 
                    for playing piano that has continued into adulthood. As a former student of Georgia myself, I took great 
                    delight in my lessons with her. She inspired me in such a way that I found a new joy in playing piano. 
                    No matter your age or skill level, Georgia will bring out the best in your playing. In addition to her 
                    phenomenal qualifications and experience,  her calm, patient and friendly personality will have you 
                    looking forward to each lesson. I highly recommend her!"</div>

                  "My two children studied piano with Georgia for five wonderful years during her time in Austin, Texas.  
                  Both her in-person and online classes were a constant source of joy for my kids: a respite from the everyday 
                  pressures of being students, kids, and siblings.  Georgia always found a way to bring lightness to her lessons 
                  while still motivating both kids to seek out their best efforts.  She has a wonderful sense of artistry and 
                  knows how to met each child at their technique level to find success and inspiration.  My children love playing 
                  the piano and I am convinced Georgia is at the root of that passion."</div>
